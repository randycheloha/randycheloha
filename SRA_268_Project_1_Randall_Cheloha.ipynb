        "The precipitation average varied wildly over the four weeks in January. The first week was the lowest with 0.02 inches of precipitation, the second week had a spike to 0.14 inches, the third week had a drop to 0.05 inches, and the fourth week had a spike to 0.17 inches. These spikes are heavily influenced by outliers of inches of heavy rain. \n"
